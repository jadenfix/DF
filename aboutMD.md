Here’s a roundup of Moondream’s standout efficiency and performance stats—along with how they stack up against peers—pulled from recent releases and benchmarks:

⸻

Model Footprint & Efficiency
	•	Core Size (FP16 → 4-bit Quant): The main 2 billion-parameter model runs in just 1 GB of memory when quantized to 4 bits—under 2 B params and 1 GB footprint versus tens of GBs for comparable VLMs  ￼.
	•	Ultra-Tiny Variant: Moondream 0.5 B ships at 479 MiB (8-bit) or 375 MiB (4-bit) compressed, with runtime memory of ~996 MiB / 816 MiB, respectively—enabling deployment on mobile and IoT devices  ￼.
	•	Quantization Gains: Switching from FP16 to 4-bit preserves 99.4 % of aggregate accuracy (74.5 vs 74.9 average across eight vision benchmarks) while slashing peak RAM by 42 % (4.2 GB→2.4 GB) and speeding up inference by 34 % on an RTX 3090  ￼.

⸻

Benchmark Performance
	•	Vision Suites: Moondream’s 4-bit model scores an average of 74.5 points vs 74.9 (FP16) on eight leading benchmarks (e.g. image captioning, VQA, object detection)  ￼.
	•	Peer Comparison: It consistently outperforms larger open-source VLMs (like LLaVA) on key vision-language tasks, placing Moondream in the top-left quadrant for “accuracy vs compute cost”  ￼ ￼.
	•	Edge-to-Cloud Cost: At scale (millions of images), Moondream’s combination of compact size and sub-15 ms latency delivers the lowest cost per inference of any VLM on the market  ￼.

⸻

New Features & Industry Benchmarks
	•	Gaze Detection: First experimental release of human-attention tracking in a VLM, adding to existing capabilities like captioning and object detection  ￼.
	•	Structured Output: Native JSON, XML, Markdown, and CSV formats simplify integration into production data pipelines  ￼.
	•	Document Understanding & Counting: The March 27, 2025 update introduced major gains in OCR and document-counting tasks, further pushing Moondream ahead of similarly sized models  ￼.

⸻

Open-Source & Ecosystem Support
	•	License & Access: Apache 2.0–licensed on GitHub, with one-click cloud runs via Modal and Hugging Face Transformers support for both FP16 and quantized variants  ￼.

⸻

Together, these metrics make Moondream the go-to choice for anyone needing state-of-the-art vision-language performance with minimal compute, whether you’re running on the cloud, the edge, or even in embedded devices.


Here’s how Moondream 2 stacks up against its peers across a range of qualitative and quantitative tests:

⸻

1. Roboflow “Seven-Test” Suite

Roboflow evaluated seven core multimodal tasks (e.g. basic scene QA, OCR, spatial reasoning, fine-grained attribute recognition).
	•	Moondream 2 passed 4 of 7 tests.
	•	It nailed general scene understanding, attribute QA, and spatial “what’s behind/next to” queries.
	•	Missed on two OCR tasks (movie-poster text & receipt reading) and dropped a character on a document-OCR test.
	•	By contrast, larger VLMs like Qwen 2.5 VL and Google’s Flamingo cleared 6–7 of these tests, but at 4× the model size and 10× the latency  ￼.

2. Task-Specialization Comparison

According to a recent roundup of top 2025 VLMs:

Model	VQA & OCR	Gaze Detection	Structured Output	Footprint
Qwen 2.5 VL	⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐	⭐⭐	⭐⭐	25 B params
Florence 2	⭐⭐⭐⭐	⭐⭐	⭐⭐⭐	10 B params
SmolVLM	⭐⭐⭐	⭐	⭐	1.3 B params
Moondream 2	⭐⭐⭐⭐	⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐	⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐	1.6 B params  ￼

Moondream leads on gaze detection and structured‐JSON/XML outputs, making it uniquely suited for safety-critical and analytics-heavy pipelines, while still holding its own on VQA-style questions.

3. Efficiency vs. Accuracy “Top-Left” Position

Moondream 2 was explicitly designed to occupy the “top-left” quadrant on Resource vs. Intelligence plots:
	•	Accuracy on standard vision benchmarks (image captioning, VQA, object detection): within 1 % of much larger open models.
	•	Compute & Memory: runs in <1 GB (4-bit quant) with 15 ms latency on a single GPU—2–5× faster and 3–8× smaller than competing 2–4 B-parameter VLMs  ￼.

⸻

Bottom Line
	•	Best-in-class efficiency: smallest memory footprint + sub-20 ms inference.
	•	Competitive accuracy: on par with 5–10× larger models on core VQA/captioning tasks.
	•	Unique capabilities: market-leading gaze-tracking and structured outputs.

Together, these place Moondream 2 squarely at the forefront of tiny, high-performance VLMs—the go-to choice when you need “big model” quality on edge or cost-sensitive deployments.
