## Impact Summary

This transformation changes DreamForge from a "comprehensive product site" into a **research-first destination** that:

1. **Establishes Research Credibility**: Papers, benchmarks, and challenges front-and-center
2. **Enables Hands-on Exploration**: Interactive demos and one-click experiments
3. **Builds Community**: Active challenges and collaborative tools
4. **Maintains Commercial Appeal**: Clear value props and easy API integration

The new design speaks directly to the VLM research community while maintaining accessibility for commercial users, positioning DreamForge as the go-to hub for tiny vision-language model research and development.
