Here’s a blueprint for an interactive, Vercel-style MVP that showcases Moondream’s advanced API, lets you tweak reward functions on the fly, and gives the CEO a sense of how you’d build “the Vercel of VLMs.” You can spin this up as a Next.js app (deployed on Vercel) to get automatic preview URLs for every Git push, just like Vercel itself.

1. High-Level Demo Flow
	1.	Model Explorer & Playground
	•	Dropdown to select from Moondream’s small-param models.
	•	Live prompt box (text or image upload) → “Generate” button.
	•	Side-by-side display of multiple model outputs for quick A/B.
	2.	Custom Reward Function Builder
	•	Visual slider controls (e.g. “focus on sharpness,” “color fidelity,” “creativity”) that adjust the linear weights of your tailored reward.
	•	Real-time “score” feedback under each generated image.
	•	“Save Reward Fn” button persists a JSON blob (e.g. {sharpness:0.3,creativity:0.7}) to your own database or to a Moondream endpoint.
	3.	On-The-Fly Fine-Tuning Trigger
	•	Once you lock in a reward function, hit “Retrain with This Reward.”
	•	Show a progress bar / live logs (via WebSocket) of the lightweight RLHF loop (e.g. 1–2 epochs on a few-shot dataset) using the Moondream advanced API.
	•	When done, automatically swap your “deployed” model in the playground to the fine-tuned version.
	4.	Automatic Preview Deploys (Vercel-Style)
	•	Hook your GitHub repo to Vercel: every branch generates its own shareable URL.
	•	In the demo, push a commit (e.g. tweak UI or reward defaults) and show the CEO the new preview link appearing in < 30 s.
	5.	Usage Dashboard
	•	Embedded chart (e.g. Chart.js) showing API call volume, average latency, cost per request.
	•	You can toggle between branches to show per-preview usage metrics (thus demonstrating multitenancy).

	•	Frontend: Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS for rapid, modern styling; Framer Motion for smooth UI transitions.
	•	Backend: Vercel Serverless Functions wrapping Moondream’s advanced API endpoints:
	•	/predict for inference
	•	/train & /reward for RLHF loops and reward-function management

3. Demo Highlights to Emphasize
	•	Sub-30 s previews on every PR branch—just like Vercel’s “Preview Deployments.”
	•	User-tunable reward functions with immediate visual feedback—demonstrates your ability to integrate Moondream’s RL pipeline into an existing workflow.
	•	Live retraining logs streamed back to the browser—shows robustness and observability.
	•	Built-in analytics dashboard proving multi-tenant usage and cost transparency.

Next Steps for CEO Walkthrough
	•	Branch Demo: Create a dummy branch (e.g. reward-tweak), push a small UI tweak, and show the new preview URL in real time.
	•	Live Reward Edit: Adjust the sliders, generate a few images, save the function, then retrain—even if it’s a 1-epoch smoke test—to prove end-to-end.
	•	Analytic Drill-down: Click into usage charts to show cost/latency per branch, illustrating true “multi-preview” capability.

This interactive MVP will both highlight Moondream’s API power and showcase your ability to glue it all together into a polished, Vercel-style developer experience.
